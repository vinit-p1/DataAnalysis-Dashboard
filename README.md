# Data Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to the Data Analysis Dashboard repository! This project aims to perform data analysis on car data to predict car prices. We will be using a dataset from Kaggle, which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge). This dataset contains valuable information about cars, and our goal is to build a predictive model for car prices.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains the following attributes:

- **ID**: Identifier for each car entry.
- **Price**: The price of the car (our target variable).
- **Levy**: Levy on the car.
- **Manufacturer**: The manufacturer of the car.
- **Model**: The model of the car.
- **Prod. year**: The production year of the car.
- **Category**: The category of the car.
- **Leather interior**: Whether the car has leather interior.
- **Fuel type**: The type of fuel the car uses.
- **Engine volume**: The engine volume of the car.
- **Mileage**: The mileage of the car.
- **Cylinders**: The number of cylinders in the car's engine.
- **Gear box type**: The type of gearbox in the car.
- **Drive wheels**: The type of drive wheels (e.g., 4x4, front-wheel drive).
- **Doors**: The number of doors in the car.
- **Wheel**: The type of wheel.
- **Color**: The color of the car.
- **Airbags**: The number of airbags in the car.

## Project Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to understand the factors that affect the pricing of cars. We aim to answer questions such as:

- What variables have the most significant impact on car prices?
- How can a new car manufacturer optimize its processes to maximize profit margins?
- Which models or machine learning techniques provide the best prediction for car prices?

## Project Workflow

Here is an outline of the steps we will follow in this project:

1. **Data Collection**: We will gather data from major car manufacturers to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**: We will perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that the dataset is ready for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types if necessary.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We will conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This will involve creating visualizations, calculating statistics, and exploring correlations among variables. We will use techniques such as correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify which parameters have the most significant impact on car prices.

4. **Model Building**: Since this is a regression problem (predicting car prices), we will split the dataset into training and test sets. We will then explore various machine learning models, such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to find the model that best predicts car prices.

5. **Model Evaluation**: We will evaluate the performance of the selected models using appropriate metrics. The model with the highest accuracy or lowest error will be chosen as the final predictive model.

6. **Dashboard for Results**: This repository contains a dashboard that showcases the results of our analysis. It includes summary statistics, key findings, and select visualizations. For more advanced and detailed visualizations, you can refer to the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.

## Jupyter Notebook for Advanced Visualizations

The dashboard prepared is pretty basic with functionality of basic visualisation of data, data outline and results. For more advanced and detailed visualizations, you can explore the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The notebook contains in-depth analyses, additional visualizations, and code for various data exploration techniques.

Thank you for exploring our Data Analysis Dashboard project! Feel free to dive into the code, data, and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the car pricing factors and predictive modeling techniques. Your feedback and contributions are highly welcome.
